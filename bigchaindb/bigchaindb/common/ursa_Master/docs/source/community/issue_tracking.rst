Tracking Issues

A great way to contribute is by reporting issues. Before reporting an issue,
please review the current open issues to see if someone has already reported
the issue.

Using JIRA
==========

Hyperledger Ursa uses JIRA as our issue tracking system:

https://jira.hyperledger.org/projects/


How to Report an Issue
======================

If you believe the issue impacts the security of a production release of a
Hyperledger project please use the responsible reporting mechanism found here:
https://wiki.hyperledger.org/security

To report all other issues, log into `jira.hyperledger.org
<https://jira.hyperledger.org>`_, which requires a
`Linux Foundation Account <https://identity.linuxfoundation.org/>`_.

Create issues in JIRA under the Hyperledger Ursa project.

When reporting an issue, please provide as much detail as possible about how
to reproduce it. If possible, explain how to reproduce the issue.
Details are very helpful. Please include the following information:

* OS version
* Ursa version
* Environment details (virtual, physical, etc.)
* Steps to reproduce the issue
* Actual results
* Expected results

If you would like, you could also describe the issue on RocketChat
(see :doc:`join_the_discussion`)
for initial feedback before submitting the issue in JIRA.
